# Controls

A basic rundown of the controls you can find on each page.
In general, there are error alerts that will indicate when something goes wrong.

## Editor Page
- Allows for selection of different tune
- Can view edit tab, output and visualiser
- Can change volume
- Can import/export to json
- Can save/delete to localStorage
- Shows variables that appear in the tune text

## Mixer page
- Allows for selection of tune
- Adds sliders dynamically from variables
- Shows basic graph from data

## Usage
It may act a bit strange with playing music when switching between pages, so please, stop the music on one page before going to the next.
On the editor page, you may have to preprocess manually.
